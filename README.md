## Inspiration
The development of this app was inspired by the original HsKAmpus app.
However, that app however had a significant problem with caching timetables, which made accessing up-to-date information hard for the users.
This app uses a server-first approach for timetable loading to ensure up-to-date information.

## Development notes
This app is based on [BetterUntis](https://github.com/SapuSeven/BetterUntis) by [SapuSeven](https://github.com/SapuSeven). Make sure to check out his project as well.

## Translating the app
Before starting with the translation process, check out the [BetterUntis](https://github.com/SapuSeven/BetterUntis) source code to avoid redoing work that has already been done.
Translations into other languages may already be available there.

## Wear OS
The wear module contains an experimental version for your Android wearables.
Feel free to check out the module and give some feedback.
